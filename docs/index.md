Hi there, this is Seungmin. I am a doctorate student at Stony Brook majoring in Data Science. Before Stony Brook, I received my bachelor’s degree at Chung-Ang University, where I was honorably supervised by professor Changwon Lim.

I’m posting some interesting parts of statistics, mathematics and data mining, so feel free to stay here! For now, what interests me is how to build a Bayesian model that is transparent, reliable and yet practical, which does not necessarily rely on Gradient Descent Algorithm. Any idea is welcome!
